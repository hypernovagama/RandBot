# RandBot
Just another dice rolling bot based on Pircbot.

## Random number generator: Mersenne Twister
Based on the balanced algorithm of Mersenne Twister, this bot is supposed to be more random than usual bots.

## Interesting tricks
I add some interesting texts and reactions to its action list, so have a try.

## Using
```
git clone https://github.com/hypernovagama/RandBot.git
cd RandBot
sbt run
```
I only test with 2.10 and 2.11 version of Scala and 2.9 is not supported.
